### Investigating antiquities trafficking with generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-3 enabled knowledge graphs: A case study, Graham, Yates, El-Roby, 2023

- discussing the use of LLM GPT-3 to semi-automate the creation of a systematic representation of the trade as a 'knowledge graph'
- GPT-3 summarizes specialist articles about the antiquities trade through the creation of statements of subject, verb, object triplets and knit them together as a network - *knowledge graph*
- the closer the entities, the closer the likelihood of a real-world connection between the two
	- this helps to generate new leads to investigate
- LLMs don't *know* anything!! just a statistical representation across parameters of patterns of word use in texts scraped from the internet
- 'one shot' prompt using OpenAI's sandbox interface to access GPT-3
- experiment
	- create suitable prompt
	- extract structured statements from unstructured texts
	- create knowledge graph embedding model
	- test for new hypotheses


### Thoughts
- well, this is the entire basis of my thesis research and the inspiration of why I'm here! this is really interesting because in my own work, I've created a working timeline of ATM based on different sources that I've read and have arranged the relationships and events in chronological order. 


## Using an LLM and Pydantic to Extract Structured Data for CHC

- 'schema' xx__xx__xx


Problems
*ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts. langchain-groq 0.2.1 requires langchain-core<0.4.0,>=0.3.15, but you have langchain-core 0.1.46 which is incompatible.* 
**how to update/change langchain-core?**


okay, restarted and didn't include code line 3 and now its working...


- tried with a sample of my own data
- at first, i used the entire body of data I have collected so far (just over 300 lines) that I converted from word to a .txt file, but it returned an error and said that there was too much for it to process (presumably, I need a paid version to process that much). so I changed the pulled text to a smaller file with ~150 lines and it accepted it.
- the set schema doesn't really fit with my dataset, so I went into schemas.py and changed the relationship types to ones that I thought would better fit my data

what I have as end result... don't really know where to go from here

whyhow.ai
- have to get an api from them (and write to them directly to get it)


**can change schema, but have to change in prompt.py too!!
