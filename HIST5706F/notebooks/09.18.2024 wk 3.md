### Static sites and Jekyll

![[Pasted image 20240918095303.png]]
Ran into quite a few errors in the process, but figured it out eventually that a hyphen was missing from the command *pelican-quickstart* which corrected the errors and allowed me to start the process
	I was trying everything possible and kept trying to exit terminal and restart but it wasn't working 



### Reading notes
### Building a Static Website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, Visconti
 
 "_Static websites_, on the other hand, do not use a database to store information; instead, all information to be displayed on each webpage is already contained in an HTML file for that webpage."

Jekyll is a software that helps you 'generate' or create a static website
	it uses page templates
		the templates are combined with other files with specific info (ie a file for each blog post on the site) and generates full HTML pages for website visitors. 
	the HTML pages are fully formed and are updated if/when they are changed

You can easily keep track of different versions of static sites by tracking how the text files that compose the site have been altered (versioning)

**GitHub and GitHub Pages**

GH pages is a free place to store the files that run a website
GH is a visual way to use git (a system for *versioning*)

**Reasons for using a static website**
1. maintenance: less updates required
2. preservation: no database âˆ´ you only need the text files that make up your site to preserve and replicate the site
3. learning: easier to learn what every aspect of your website does
4. more customization possible
5. free hosting
6. versioning: can track your site and roll back to an earlier state of any blog post, page, or the site itself 
7. security: there's no databases to protect from hackers
8. speed: faster loading time
9. learning 2: easy to learn to use from back end
10. built for blogging
11. templating automated repeated tasks: you can create templates to have repeat features


### Running a Collaborative Research Website and Blog with Jekyll and GitHub, Visconti, Walsh, Scholar's Lab Community

Why use a blog as a collaborative research notebook?
	good way for a small group of researchers to share their ongoing work with the scholarly community and public



### Class notes
Pelican Collection Builder - Frederik Elwert (github)
	might be useful for future (image collection database organization)
Class updates: **obsidian for writing website, Pelican for publishing!!**



### Pelican
-m venv: virtual environment




### PROCESS
1. install went well initially, solved above issue by adding hyphen to pelican-quickstart
2. opened new vault **"open folder as a vault** using the content file that was created through terminal
3. played around and made some test pages on obsidian to push using pelican
4. looking for error "fromat"
	1. don't know what fromat is or where the word format was misspelled 
5. lesson: sometimes simplicity is best - mindful for accessibility
6. ![[Pasted image 20240918110419.png]]python -m http.server (to run)
7. unfortunately, the hyperlinks don't work and I can't click 'School' to get to that page I made
8. I also don't know where my images are
