	X <- X push something (backwards)

Sublime/notepad++ to write code
	mycode.py (python)
	mycode.r (R)

$pythonmycode.py

*invoke*
write code in a text editor and invoke


IDE - a program that will run (Jupyter, VSCode, RStudio)
	with file explorer



## Graphing Networks

nodes, edges, graphs

multimode, unimode, bipartite


-- can you layer specific graphs on top of one another to create a 3d graph that has connections to one another and its stacked

Betweenness
- what is holding two 'groups' together?
- if that *breaks* how does it affect the graph and the node clusters?
*The Strength of Weak Ties, Mark S. Granovetter*

Source Target

Community Detection / Modularity
- looking at all the pairs at once - which are more similar to each other than they are to everything else?
	- can be useful - it can highlight clusters of things that might not have otherwise been seen

Privileging graphs - looking at it left to right and down 
	does this change if you're a non-native english speaker? does the way we read language affect the ways we digest the graph?

Directed graph - one way relationship (power, influence...)
	we can't necessarily know beforehand the nature of that relationship
Undirected relationship 
	you don't know the nature, but you know it exists

small world - looks random, behaves ordered



Ethics - playing with data (graphing) that belongs to a grant/project
	SHRC - data re-use plan
	Zenoto - repository
